# Store Chunky Bytes

Simple API to :

1. Persist large byte arrays, across multiple chunks, in the blob storage of your preference (memory, cloud, ipfs, etc.) 
2. Retrieve slices of data, based on the offset, independent of the individual chunk boundaries 

Persisted data is content addressable, hence immutable and versionable.

Used in conjunction with [content defined chunkers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dstanesc/wasm-chunking-webpack-eval)  (eg. Fastcdc and Buzhash) offers chunk deduplication across versions of data.

The intended usage is to persist and access collections of fixed size records. In this case the records can be retrieved extremely efficient (O1) based on the offsets computed externally using mathematic formulas rather than scanning the data.


## Usage
